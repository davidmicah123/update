        <p class="main_sport_text">
            Food is a vital part of student life. It’s the source of energy a student utilizes to absorb all the nutrition to learn things. Not only does food help as a good source of energy, but it also helps in the proper development of the brain and physical strength. For students, eating healthy is not an option, it is a necessity!
        </p>
        <h1 class="sport_sub_headings"> Students And Healthy Eating</h1>
        <p class="main_sport_text">
            There is a direct relationship with students eating healthy foods. According to nutritionists, students who are prone to healthy eating habits score well in academics than to those who adopt a poor diet.
            Student life is pretty much busy with loads of lectures to comprehend, working on different assignments and projects and ultimately getting prepared for the final assessment. Being so absorbed in today’s fast tech era, they adopt an eating style which is quick. This is the main reason most of the students prefer to eat junk or fast food as it is a quick way to get full without breaking their wallet!
        </p>
        <h1 class="sport_sub_headings">Consequences Of Not Eating Healthy</h1>
        <p class="main_sport_text">
            Poor academic performance
            Depression

        <h1 class="sport_sub_headings">Obesity and Overweight</h1>
        <img src="images/obesity.jpg" class="sport_img" alt="">
        
        <p class="main_sport_text">
            Students are becoming obese and overweight by not having healthy eating habits. The more junk you eat, the more you are prone to getting obese to the extent that it is a threat to your life.
            According to the research of the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, 39.8% of adults aged 20 and over are obese and 71.6% of adults aged 20 and over are overweight, including obesity (2015–2016). The stats for children and adolescents are alarmingly high with 20.6% obesity ratio in 12–19 year olds (2015–2016), 18.4% obesity ratio in 6–11 year old kids (2015–2016) and 13.9% in 2–5 years kids (2015–2016).
        </p>
        <h1 class="sport_sub_headings">Poor Academic Performance</h1>
        <p class="main_sport_text">
            We all know how hyperactive our kids can become due to the consumption of sugar and sugary products. Excessive sugar intake in the form of soda drinks and trying to satisfy that sweet tooth also leads to fast decaying of our teeth. One research at “The Journal of School Health” proves this point by observing students to see if their academic performance was affected or not <br><br>
        According to the research, they eliminated the consumption of soda drinks for the sixth graders and exposed them to more physical activities and exercise. The academic performance of these sixth graders was higher as compared to the other students in the class who were using soda drinks.
        The study concluded that if the students are given a healthy diet and more exposure to physical activities like exercise and other outdoor sports, they will learn more.
        </p>
        <h1 class="sport_sub_headings">Depression</h1>
        <p class="main_sport_text">
            In talking about healthy foods, researchers were amazed to know that students who didn’t consume a healthier diet and were Trans fat (processed food) addictive faced depression by 48%. The research was performed over the course of 6 years and 12,059 people participated in order to find the relation between depression and Trans fats intake (Sánchez-Villegas, January 26, 2011). <br> <br>
The research was published in the Public Library of Science and Almudena Sanchez-Villegas, an associate professor of preventive medicine at the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria was the first author of the research.
According to the professor, Trans fats are a major source of inflammation in the neurotransmitters of our body resulting in a bad mood. If students can adopt a healthier diet on a daily basis, they can help fight depression better.

        <h1 class="sport_sub_headings">Benefits Of Eating Healthy For Students </h1>
        <p class="main_sport_text">
            In order to reverse this alarmingly disturbing situation, we need to help our kids adopt healthy eating habits. Eating healthy can only be possible if you can start practicing today.
Students need all the necessary vitamins and nutrients for good academic performance. The “eat the rainbow” rule is an important and easier task to start if you want to score high by eating healthy. If you are a parent and are constantly fighting a battle of what to pack for your kid’s lunch, you can benefit from following this simple healthy rule: <br> <br> Eat the rainbow refers to eating fruits and vegetables of the colors of a rainbow. It means that if a person eats the shades of yellow, green, red, blue, purple and white, he/she will get all the necessary vitamins, minerals and nutrition to be a competitive student.
Let me explain how beneficial some fruits and vegetables can be for your child’s school performance:
        </p>
        <h1 class="sport_sub_headings">Helps In The Prevention Of Cancer</h1>
        <p class="main_sport_text">
            With cancer, cancerous cells damage other healthy cells around them. Fruits and vegetables, which are rich in antioxidants, can help you fight against cancer. The antioxidants are responsible for stabilizing the free radicals which are unstable and constantly trying to damage other cells. A healthy diet for students can prevent them from getting cancer, and who wants cancer? NO ONE!
        </p><br>
        <h1 class="sport_sub_headings">Helps In The Prevention Of Heart Disease</h1>
        <p class="main_sport_text">
            Healthy eating habits for students can prevent students from getting heart disease. Heart attack, heart stroke or any other heart-related diseases are caused by consuming loads of bad cholesterol rich in triglycerides. If these triglyceride levels increase due to continuous bad eating habits, it will cause your arteries to block and potentially welcoming a fatal attack or stroke.
            A well balanced healthy diet for students can help them fight heart diseases. Eating healthy doesn’t mean that you have to shut off all the fats from your meals. You can always adopt good fats which have low cholesterol levels and are highly nutritious. Examples of good fats are fish, nuts, olive oil, and seeds.

        Importance of Sports in a student’s life !

“Sports has the power to change the world” — Nelson Mandela
No matter how important studies are in one’s life, there is no doubt that sports plays a vital role in the overall development of students. The values that sport teaches us cannot be taught through books. When we play a game or a sport, there are so many things someone learns unknowingly! While studies educate us on various aspects such as science and math, sports teaches us to cope with the real world! A few examples would include skills like teamwork, leadership, patience, discipline, learning from failure are developed only when children play sports. More importantly these skills are equally important when it comes to studies. To bring up a healthy spirit of competition among the students, to build up decision-making skills, and also to ensure the all-round development of a child’s personality sports plays a big role. A clear example can be seen in the lives of our Paralympians , when nothing seemed possible it was sports which made them what they are now !
Sports instils an attitude of not giving up and to bounce back after defeat What I like about sports the most is that it is a combination of fun and fitness. Sports is gaining greater popularity in our country after the initiation of the National Sports Day by our Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Post the Tokyo Olympics this year, Indians have moved on from just following cricket to learning and viewing other sports like hockey, badminton, golf as well — where India did unprecedentedly well.
Our country should be equally good in sports as it is in the field of science. I would like to conclude by saying that every child must play outdoor sports on a regular basis and showcase their talent to the world. Who knows who will be the next Olympic Gold medallist for our country !

When it comes to school life, most students will often tell you they spend a majority of their time reading or doing various leisure activities like video gaming or watching movies. Sports is seen as a reserve for the few who are talented. Despite how much we may support the importance of focusing on our studies, it is hard to deny the existing evidence that sports are beneficial to a student. Many people graduated with excellent grades and were also good sportspeople. It is therefore imperative we assess the various benefits that a student will stand to gain from engaging in sports activities while also attending class.
